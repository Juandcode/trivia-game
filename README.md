# Description

Build an application that when you enter, it must ask you to enter some data

after that I will be able to choose a category of questions and then it will randomly show questions that are in a question bank with simple answers, but only one is correct.

You must ask me to answer some questions, and when the last one is finished, you must give me a message of congratulations and add me to the ranking of users who have finished the trivia game.

You must show me the time it took me to finish this trivia
